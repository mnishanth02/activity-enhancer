# GitHub Copilot Agent Instructions: Feature-Focused YouTube Script Generator (v1.0, Oct 2025)

## Description
Generate focused, feature-specific YouTube video scripts during active development. This prompt analyzes recent commits to identify completed features and creates detailed technical scripts (3-7 minutes) with intelligent file organization and workflow integration.

## Version
1.0 — Feature-centric development workflow integration
- Feature detection via commit analysis and conventional commits
- Intelligent script organization (standalone vs integrated)
- Development workflow optimized
- Modular script design for easy combination
- Production-ready output with complete metadata

---

## OBJECTIVE

Create **feature-focused YouTube scripts** (3-7 minutes, ~500-1000 words) by analyzing recent development work and generating detailed technical content for completed features. The system intelligently decides whether to create new scripts, update existing ones, or append to current documentation based on feature scope and existing content.

---

## INPUTS

- **Feature Scope (optional):** `FEATURE_NAME` or `COMMIT_RANGE` (e.g., "authentication", "abc123..def456")
  - If **not provided**, analyzes recent commits to auto-detect completed features
- **Script Organization Preference (optional):** `standalone|integrated|auto`
  - `standalone`: Create separate script file for this feature
  - `integrated`: Add as chapter to existing main script
  - `auto`: Let system decide based on analysis (default)
- **Commit Depth:** `COMMIT_DEPTH` (default: 10) - how many recent commits to analyze

---

## EXECUTION PHASES

### PHASE 1: Feature Detection & Analysis

> Copilot Agent should execute these commands **sequentially** and **capture outputs** for analysis.

#### 1.1 Recent Development Analysis
```bash
# Set analysis depth (default to 10 recent commits)
COMMIT_DEPTH="${COMMIT_DEPTH:-10}"

echo "=== RECENT DEVELOPMENT ANALYSIS ==="
echo "Analyzing last ${COMMIT_DEPTH} commits..."

# Recent commits with full context
git log --pretty=format:"%h | %ad | %an | %s" --date=short -${COMMIT_DEPTH}

# Files changed in recent commits
echo -e "\n=== FILES CHANGED (Recent ${COMMIT_DEPTH} commits) ==="
git diff --name-status HEAD~${COMMIT_DEPTH}..HEAD

# Commit stats
echo -e "\n=== COMMIT STATISTICS ==="
git diff --stat HEAD~${COMMIT_DEPTH}..HEAD
```

#### 1.2 Feature Boundary Detection
```bash
echo "=== FEATURE DETECTION ==="

# Analyze conventional commit patterns
git log --pretty=format:"%h|%s" -${COMMIT_DEPTH} | awk -F'|' '
BEGIN {
    print "Conventional Commit Analysis:"
    feat_count = fix_count = refactor_count = docs_count = chore_count = other_count = 0
}
{
    commit_hash = $1
    message = $2

    if (message ~ /^feat(\(|:)/) {
        feat_count++
        print "FEATURE: " commit_hash " - " message
    }
    else if (message ~ /^fix(\(|:)/) {
        fix_count++
        print "FIX: " commit_hash " - " message
    }
    else if (message ~ /^refactor(\(|:)/) {
        refactor_count++
        print "REFACTOR: " commit_hash " - " message
    }
    else if (message ~ /^docs(\(|:)/) {
        docs_count++
        print "DOCS: " commit_hash " - " message
    }
    else if (message ~ /^chore(\(|:)/) {
        chore_count++
        print "CHORE: " commit_hash " - " message
    }
    else {
        other_count++
        print "OTHER: " commit_hash " - " message
    }
}
END {
    print "\nSUMMARY:"
    print "Features: " feat_count
    print "Fixes: " fix_count
    print "Refactors: " refactor_count
    print "Docs: " docs_count
    print "Chores: " chore_count
    print "Other: " other_count
}'

# Identify primary feature from most recent feat: commit
LATEST_FEATURE=$(git log --pretty=format:"%s" -${COMMIT_DEPTH} | grep "^feat" | head -1)
echo -e "\nLatest Feature Detected: ${LATEST_FEATURE}"
```

#### 1.3 Current Script Organization Analysis
```bash
echo "=== CURRENT SCRIPT ORGANIZATION ==="

# Check existing scripts in docs/youtube/
if [ -d "docs/youtube" ]; then
    echo "Existing YouTube scripts:"
    find docs/youtube -name "*.md" -type f | head -10

    # Count total scripts and get latest
    SCRIPT_COUNT=$(find docs/youtube -name "*.md" -type f | wc -l)
    echo "Total scripts: ${SCRIPT_COUNT}"

    # Check for main/index script
    if [ -f "docs/youtube/main-script.md" ] || [ -f "docs/youtube/index.md" ]; then
        echo "Main script exists - integration possible"
        MAIN_SCRIPT_EXISTS="true"
    else
        echo "No main script found - standalone recommended"
        MAIN_SCRIPT_EXISTS="false"
    fi
else
    echo "No YouTube docs folder - will create structure"
    mkdir -p docs/youtube
    MAIN_SCRIPT_EXISTS="false"
fi
```

#### 1.4 Technical Context Extraction
```bash
echo "=== TECHNICAL CONTEXT ==="

# Extract technical details from recent changes
echo "Changed file types:"
git diff --name-only HEAD~${COMMIT_DEPTH}..HEAD | grep -E '\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx|py|go|rs|java|php|rb|vue|svelte)$' | awk -F'.' '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq -c

# Component/module analysis
echo -e "\nComponents/Modules affected:"
git diff --name-only HEAD~${COMMIT_DEPTH}..HEAD | grep -E '(component|hook|util|service|api|route)' | head -10

# Configuration changes
echo -e "\nConfiguration files changed:"
git diff --name-only HEAD~${COMMIT_DEPTH}..HEAD | grep -E '\.(json|yaml|yml|toml|ini|conf|config)$' | head -5
```

#### 1.5 Feature Complexity Assessment
```bash
echo "=== FEATURE COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT ==="

# Lines changed
LINES_ADDED=$(git diff --numstat HEAD~${COMMIT_DEPTH}..HEAD | awk '{sum+=$1} END{print sum}')
LINES_DELETED=$(git diff --numstat HEAD~${COMMIT_DEPTH}..HEAD | awk '{sum+=$2} END{print sum}')
FILES_CHANGED=$(git diff --name-only HEAD~${COMMIT_DEPTH}..HEAD | wc -l)

echo "Lines added: ${LINES_ADDED}"
echo "Lines deleted: ${LINES_DELETED}"
echo "Files changed: ${FILES_CHANGED}"

# Suggest script length based on complexity
if [ "${FILES_CHANGED}" -gt 15 ] || [ "${LINES_ADDED}" -gt 500 ]; then
    SUGGESTED_LENGTH="6-8 minutes"
    COMPLEXITY="high"
elif [ "${FILES_CHANGED}" -gt 5 ] || [ "${LINES_ADDED}" -gt 100 ]; then
    SUGGESTED_LENGTH="4-6 minutes"
    COMPLEXITY="medium"
else
    SUGGESTED_LENGTH="3-4 minutes"
    COMPLEXITY="low"
fi

echo "Complexity: ${COMPLEXITY}"
echo "Suggested script length: ${SUGGESTED_LENGTH}"
```

### PHASE 2: Script Organization Decision

#### 2.1 Organization Logic
```bash
echo "=== SCRIPT ORGANIZATION DECISION ==="

# Decision matrix based on:
# 1. Feature complexity
# 2. Existing scripts
# 3. Feature relatedness
# 4. User preference

if [ "${SCRIPT_ORGANIZATION_PREFERENCE:-auto}" = "standalone" ]; then
    ORGANIZATION_DECISION="standalone"
    echo "Decision: STANDALONE (user preference)"
elif [ "${SCRIPT_ORGANIZATION_PREFERENCE:-auto}" = "integrated" ]; then
    ORGANIZATION_DECISION="integrated"
    echo "Decision: INTEGRATED (user preference)"
else
    # Auto-decision logic
    if [ "${COMPLEXITY}" = "high" ] || [ "${MAIN_SCRIPT_EXISTS}" = "false" ]; then
        ORGANIZATION_DECISION="standalone"
        echo "Decision: STANDALONE (complexity: ${COMPLEXITY}, main_exists: ${MAIN_SCRIPT_EXISTS})"
    else
        ORGANIZATION_DECISION="integrated"
        echo "Decision: INTEGRATED (suitable for addition to existing content)"
    fi
fi

# Set target file path
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d")
if [ "${ORGANIZATION_DECISION}" = "standalone" ]; then
    TARGET_FILE="docs/youtube/feature-${TIMESTAMP}-$(echo "${LATEST_FEATURE}" | sed 's/feat: //' | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/-/g' | cut -c1-30).md"
else

## SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR COPILOT AGENT

1. **Feature Detection Priority:**
   - Look for `feat:` commits first
   - If user provides FEATURE_NAME, use that as context
   - If user provides COMMIT_RANGE, analyze that specific range
   - Default to analyzing recent commits for automatic detection

2. **Content Quality Standards:**
   - Include specific commit hashes in explanations
   - Reference actual file paths and line numbers where possible
   - Provide practical code examples from the actual implementation
   - Explain the "why" behind implementation decisions

3. **Organization Intelligence:**
   - Consider existing script structure and length
   - Prefer standalone for complex features (>5 files changed, >200 lines)
   - Prefer integrated for simple features that relate to existing content
   - Always respect user's explicit preference if provided

4. **Production Readiness:**
   - Include complete metadata for video production
   - Provide specific screen recording instructions
   - Generate editing markers for post-production
   - Create actionable checklists

5. **Workflow Integration:**
   - Tag commits appropriately for future script updates
   - Maintain script catalog for easy reference
   - Support iterative development (can be run multiple times)
   - Prepare for future feature additions

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Handle cases where no recent features are found
   - Provide fallbacks for missing git history
   - Give clear feedback about what was detected vs assumed
   - Offer suggestions for manual feature specification
